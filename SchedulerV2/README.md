# MCU Schedulers

This repository contains three versions of microcontroller-based schedulers implemented in C.

## Schedulers

### Scheduler V1: Simple Scheduler
- Basic scheduler without initial delay.
- Suitable for projects with tasks that need to run periodically.

### Scheduler V2: Delayed Scheduler
- Enhanced scheduler with initial delay for each task.
- Useful when tasks require a delay before their first execution.

### Scheduler V3: Priority Scheduler
- Advanced scheduler supporting tasks with the same priority level.
- Enables scheduling multiple tasks at the same priority level.

## Getting Started

Each scheduler version is contained in a separate directory. Follow the instructions in each directory's README for specific setup and usage details.

## Directory Structure

- `SchedulerV1/`: Simple Scheduler Version 1
- `SchedulerV2/`: Delayed Scheduler Version 2
- `SchedulerV3/`: Priority Scheduler Version 3
